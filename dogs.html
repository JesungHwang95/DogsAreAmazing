    <h2>To the Noble Dog</h2>
    <p>
        The domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris)
        <sup>[4]</sup> is a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication">domesticated</a>
        wolf. The dog
        descended from
        an ancient, extinct wolf,
        <sup>[5][6]</sup> with the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf">modern grey wolf
        </a> being the dog's nearest living relative.
        <sup>[7]</sup> The dog was the first species to be domesticated,
        <sup>[8][7]</sup> by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherers</a> over 15,00 years ago,
        <sup>[6]</sup>before the development of agriculture.
        <sup>[1]</sup>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93canine_bond"> Their long associateion with humans</a>
        has
        led dogs to be uniquely adapted to human
        behavior,
        <sup>[9]</sup> leading to a large number of domestic individuals
        <sup>[10]</sup> and the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.
        <sup>[11]</sup>

        wow!

    </p>
    <p>
        The dog has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_breeding">selectively bred</a> over
        millennia
        for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.
        <sup>[12]</sup> Dogs are sub classified into breeds, which vary widely in shape, size, and
        color.<sup>[13]</sup>
        They
        perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the
        military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. This influence on human society has given them
        the
        sobriquet of "man's best friend."
